# 💵 Salary Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Salary Analysis** project is a data analysis initiative to explore salary trends and patterns across different job, demographic, or experience-related variables. It aims to provide insights into how factors such as job role, experience, education (or other relevant attributes) influence salary outcomes.

This repository is intended for **data analysis, exploration, and visualization** — useful for understanding compensation dynamics and generating insights for stakeholders or individuals.

## 🎯 Goals & Objectives
- Load and preprocess salary-related dataset  
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and relationships  
- Visualize salary distributions across features (e.g. role, experience, region, education)  
- Derive insights and patterns that highlight key determinants of salary  

---

## 🧠 Workflow & Methodology

1. **Data Ingestion**  
   - Load the dataset (e.g. CSV, Excel) containing salary and relevant attributes  

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values, outliers, incorrect entries  
   - Encode categorical variables if needed  
   - Normalize or transform data for analysis  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyze central tendencies, distribution, and variance  
   - Investigate relationships between salary and other attributes  
   - Identify patterns, correlations, and potential outliers  

4. **Visualization & Reporting**  
   - Create charts/plots (histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, bar charts, etc.) to represent findings  
   - Summarize insights for stakeholders or further reference
